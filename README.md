# Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

This repository contains a research-based study on common network security threats.
The goal of this task was to understand how major network attacks work, their real-world impact, and how defenders and SOC teams detect and mitigate them.

## Network Security Threats Covered

### 1. DoS / DDoS Attacks

Studied how attackers overwhelm systems to disrupt availability, the impact on organizations, and common defensive controls such as rate limiting, CDNs, and traffic monitoring.

### 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

Analyzed how attackers intercept and manipulate communications using techniques like ARP spoofing and rogue Wi-Fi, along with mitigations such as TLS, HTTPS enforcement, and VPNs.

### 3. Spoofing Attacks

Researched IP, ARP, and email spoofing, their role in phishing and MITM attacks, and prevention methods including packet filtering, DAI, and email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

## Key Learning Outcome

This task strengthened my understanding of network-level attack patterns, their impact on the CIA triad, and the importance of layered defenses and continuous monitoring from a defender’s perspective.
